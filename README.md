# Linux-File-Integrity-Monitoring-using-Wazuh
A practical project showing how Wazuh monitors and alerts on file changes in Linux systems.


OBJECTIVE 

The objective of this project is to implement a File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) system on a Linux environment using Wazuh to detect, track, and alert on any unauthorized or suspicious changes made to critical files and directories. This project aims to strengthen system security by ensuring that any modification to important files is immediately identified, logged, and investigated.


TOOLS USED

UBUNTU SERVER
UBUNTU DESKTOP
VRITUALBOX
WAZUH SERVER
WAZUH AGENT


LESSON LEARNED

I learned how Wazuh File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) works to track changes in important Linux files.

I understood how to configure monitored paths and set up FIM rules for detecting modifications, deletions, and permission changes.

I gained practical experience in generating test changes and verifying the alerts inside the Wazuh dashboard.

I learned how FIM helps improve security by quickly identifying unauthorized or suspicious file activities.

I also improved my skills in Linux command usage and Wazuh agent–manager configuration during the project.
